## Backend

### Important Commands
    - Run "npm install" before starting the backend to ensure all dependencies are installed
    - Running the frontend (will eventually be for connecting with AWS Elastic Beanstalk): npm run start
    - Running the frontend for DEVELOPMENT (nodemon will restart everytime a backend change is made): npm run dev
    
### Important Information on Security
    - Create a .env file in the backend folder
    - Make sure to follow the .env.example template (but DON'T fill in sensitive information here)
